I did some number crunching in a previous thread, where I mistakenly stated the Dahlmeier had scored more points than Fourcade this season, if we subtract Fourcade's worst two results. That was wrong. My calculations only go back to the 08-09 season (scoring was different before that), and only counts world cup points. 
The best season ever by any biathlete would be Martin Fourcade's 2012-13 season, with 1248 points (averaging 52 points per race). The best season ever by a female biathlete was Tora Berger's 2012-13 season, with 1234 points (averaging 51.416... points per race). In both cases, I subtract two races in the denominator. 
Going by this season, 21 races have been completed - 5 remain. That means the objective for Fourcade and Dahlmeier (I'm also using Fourcade in this calculation) is to reach or beat Fourcade's record of 1248 points, which is currently the best season ever. Dahlmeier has participated in 19 individual races this season, Fourcade in 21. Dahlmeier has scored 53.84 points per race, Fourcade has scored 53.71 . Insane numbers, when you consider that a second place gives you 54 points. 
Working with these numbers, I find that Fourcade will have 1322.57 points after the season (after subtracting the 74 points for his worst results) and Dahlmeier will have 1292.21 points. I Fourcade's total by the following calculation (1128/21)x26 -74 and Dahlmeier's by (1023/19)x24. Dahlmeier is, going strictly by world cup points, heading for the best season ever. If it wasn't for Fourcade going for an even better season. For a bonus, if Fourcade skips Kontiolathi (which I believe he will - it will give him extra time to prepare for next year's olympics), his predicted points become 1289.14 (=(1128/21)x24), slightly less than Dahlmeier.
This calculation doesn't account for any extra weight a world championship (or a record for most gold medals at a world championship) or an olympic gold medal may have. 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789
